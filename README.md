You are about to use a CLI weather application example based on openweathermap.org API.
Before that you need to apply for a free API key: https://openweathermap.org/price.
Then download all the files and create .env file in the same directory. It will contain:
'''
WEA_API={free openweathermap.org API you have applied for}
'''
